    <p>Hung was I on the windswept tree;Nine full nights I hung,Pierced by a spear, a pledge to the god,To Odin, myself to myself,On that tree which none can know the sourceFrom whence its root has run.None gave me bread, none brought a horn.Then low to earth I looked.I caught up the runes, roaring, I took them,And fainting, back I fell.Nine mighty lays I learned from the sonOf Bolthorn, Bestlaâ€™s father,And a draught I had of the holy meadPoured out of Odrerir.Then fruitful I grew, and greatly to thrive,In wisdom began to wax.A single word to a second word led,A single poem a second found.Runes will you find, and fateful staves,Very potent staves, very powerful staves,Staves the great gods made, stained by the mighty sage,And graven by the speaker of gods.</p>
